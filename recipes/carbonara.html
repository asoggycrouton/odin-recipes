        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>At its core, this Italian dish is from Rome and is super super <strong>simple.</strong> It's made from egg, hard sharp cheese, pepper, and guanciale â€“ a cured pork. If guanciale is a little too hard to find pancetta or bacon works in a snap!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Pancetta</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
            <li>Eggs (Just Yolks)</li>
            <li>Pecorino Cheese</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Basil (For Garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Crisp the pancetta:</strong> Add the pancetta to a large skillet and saute over medium-low heat until crisp. Transfer the pancetta to a bowl using a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li><strong>Get saucey:</strong> Add the half and half to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks into the sauce followed by the Parmesan cheese. Stir in the black pepper. Taste for salt and season if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the carbonara:</strong> Add the cooked spaghetti, bacon and basil to the skillet and toss well to combine. Garnish with more cheese and serve hot!</li>
